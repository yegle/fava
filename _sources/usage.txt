Getting Started
===============

If you're new to beancount or double-entry accounting in general, we
recommend `Command-line Accounting in Context
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1e4Vz3wZB_8-ZcAwIFde8X5CjzKshE4-OXtVVHm4RQ8s/>`__,
a motivational document written by Martin Blais, the author of beancount.

To learn how to create your beancount file, refer to `Getting Started with
Beancount
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1P5At-z1sP8rgwYLHso5sEy3u4rMnIUDDgob9Y_BYuWE/>`__
guide. Martin Blais has written a great deal of very detailed documention for
beancount, see the `Beancount Documentation
<https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RaondTJCS_IUPBHFNdT8oqFKJjVJDsfsn6JEjBG04eA>`__
page for an index of the available documentation.

Requirements
------------

fava can run wherever a Python 3.4+ installation is available, and is
known to run on Mac OSX, Linux, and Cygwin.

Note that developing on fava requires npm and NodeJS, both available on Mac OSX
and Linux, but currently not on Cygwin. See :doc:`development` for more
information on how to get started developing on fava.

Installation
------------

You will need `Python 3 <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ (at least version 3.4).
Then you can use ``pip`` to install fava by running::

    pip3 install beancount-fava

which will also pull in all required dependencies including beancount, if you
don't have it installed already.


Starting fava
-------------

Start fava by running::

    fava ledger.beancount

pointing it to your beancount file -- and visit the web interface at
`http://localhost:5000 <http://localhost:5000>`__.

There are some command-line options available, run ``fava --help`` for an overview.

For more information on fava's features, refer to the help pages that are
available through fava's web-interface.  fava comes with Gmail-style keyboard
shortcuts; press ``?`` to show an overview.
